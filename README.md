Data is stored in a JSON file for persistence.

Add Students: Users can input new student details and store them.

Update Students: Modify existing student records.

Delete Students: Remove student entries from the system.

##**Future Enhancements**

Implement a database (MySQL) instead of JSON for data storage.

Add user roles and permissions.

Improve UI design for better user experience.
